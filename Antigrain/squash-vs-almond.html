<p>Today was another big day in the kitchen. With my mini-muffin tins greased (with coconut oil) and my oven pre-heated to 350, I was determined to test a variation of a paleo banana muffin recipe I found using a sample of our potential Butternut Squash flour. The original recipe (found <a class="inline-link" href="http://sooopaleo.blogspot.ca/2013/03/banana-almond-flour-muffins.html?m=1">here on SoooPaleo</a>) calls for strictly almond flour. I made one batch of mini-muffins following the recipe as directed and another batch using 1/3 almond flour and 2/3 squash flour: you know, to compare. Note: you can find the <a class="inline-link" href="mini-muffs.html">modified recipe here.</a></p>

<p>SPOILER ALERT: They both tasted awesome. But a few observations were apparent:</p>


<h6 class="recipie-heading">Prep + Baking:</h6>
<ol>
<li><p>First, the batter with the squash flour was THICK. I added some additional liquid (Almond milk) to bring the consistency down.</li></p>

<li><p>Because of the extra volume in the batter (I think), the squash flour batch ended up yielding an additional 2 mini-muffins—nice.</li></p>

<li><p>The Squash flour batch took some extra time in the oven—18 min vs 13 min—again, this is probably related to the extra liquid.</li></p>
<li><p>The Almond-flour-only batch rose a bit more and a had a nicer shape. might be due to the liquid to baking soda ratio. I will test that in the next batch.</li></p>
</ol>



<h6 class="recipie-heading">Taste:</h6>
<ol>

<li><p>Both tasted great! After an extremely stringent and objective test (kidding) it came down to preference. Of the 4 who tasted them, the verdict was split. However, a few observations were apparent here as well.</li></p>

<li><p>The squash flour batch was MOIST. In a good way. Nut flours due have a tendency to come out dry. The idea behind the Squash flour from the beginning is that it would help add some moisture to the end product. In this case, that it did.</li></p>

<li><p>The squash flavor wasn't supper apparent but it did have that zucchini-bread-like kind of flavor. Overall a positive thing in this recipe, I'd say.</li></p>

<li><p>The density was good, and the texture was closure to that of a traditional muffin. On the spread test (we added some nut butter to a couple as we were eating them) the squash flour held up and didn't crumble. They also complemented the nut butter flavor really well.</li></p>

<p>Overall, definitely a good first batch with the Squash flour, and seems like it is showing some serious promise. I'm going to make a few adjustments to this recipe and repost an update here. I want to try one that is more 50/50 with almond flour to squash flour and play with the baking soda amount a bit. Still want to try a few other types of dishes as well before moving forward—maybe a pizza crust, a traditional bread and a pancake or something!</p>
