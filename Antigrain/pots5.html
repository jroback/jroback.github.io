One of the most important things to consider when creating a food product is the context it will live in within the store. As a specialty grocery item, that means the specialty food section, the rice aisle at specialty grocery stores, and the ultimate goal: the rice aisle at national grocery stores.</p>

<p>Though the initial plan might be to sell the product online, we have to think mass-retail from day one. Some great examples of this exist in adjacent food categories: (see my post on <a  class="inline-link" href="#">Silk and milk-alternatives</a> for more).</p>

<p>What Silk did right, from the get go, was establish their competitive set. Rather than place themselves in the milk alternatives section with all the other soy milk products, they placed their product in the dairy case right between the skim milk and the 1%. Silk's product didn't have to be refrigerated, but they spent more to package it and stock it there because that's where their competition was. They certainly weren't the first to market with a soy-milk product, but they were the ones to put soy-milk on the map.</p>

<p>The rice aisle is where Anti-Grain needs to be. While Paleo consumers are likely going to be our biggest advocates, it's the mass-consumer (the health and calorie-conscious) who are going to keep us in business. Our product needs to be put into consideration while they reach between the Uncle Ben's and the Rice-Land.</p> 

<p>At that moment, color and packaging are going to be our most important distinguishers. Which means those decisions are ones I need to make ASAP. I'm still doing research and testing on the appropriate size for the package but I think I've settled on a gussetted or "stand-up" pouch as the form. These pouches are extremely versatile and allow for easily and efficient fulfillment by a co-packer. I'm thinking a mint color for the identity and after visiting the aisle, I'm leaning towards either a sliver or a kraft paper colour as a secondary element. I still have some more stores to visit before I start looking into options but I will be sure to post some preliminary pics when I have them ready.</p>
