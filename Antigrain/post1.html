<p id="strong">[DISCLAIMER]<p>
<p>This is my first stab at identity design and I am not, by any means, a designer.</p>

<p>I've been hacking my way through Adobe Illustrator and even took a <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.skillshare.com">Skillshare</a> class (love that site) on how to hand-make custom type from a pen and paper illustration. After a couple of months of passively thinking and playing around with it, I'm pretty happy with the result.</p>

<p>The type is handmade and together with the marque, I think it reflects the "rebellious in the least serious way" tone I'm going for. The name, funny enough, took a really long time to land on. I had some other names that I was playing with, all of which were terrible. The best one I had was a word that relates to the genealogical classification of cauliflower. Embarrassing.</p>

<p>When I landed on the name "Anti-Grain Foods" I knew I had it. From a brand standpoint, it's a name I like for a couple of reasons:</p> 

<p>First, it has a really nice cadence to it, one that I feel really helps it compete with traditional wheat products. In a world of Whole-Wheat, Whole-Grain, Multi-Grain, and 7-Grain; Anti-Grain is as much a classification as it is a brand. This gives it the potential to become the generic.</p>

<p>I think it is also interesting that it is less about what is is than what it's not--the fact that it's against something. The name could easily be "Cauliflower Foods", "Vegetable-Grain" or "Paleo-Buddy" but all of these are inherently less interesting and less impactful. Fact: consumers have no connection to or desire for, cauliflower. In fact it's quite likely the opposite. What it's made out of is not it's strongest attribute, and is something it will likely have to overcome to appeal to the mass market.</p> 

<p>However, its benefitâ€”the fact that it is grain-free, is something that a lot of people can be excited about and rally around. Not just the Cross-Fitting Paleo types, but everyone in between--from the gluten-free to the calorie conscious.</p>

<p>Next thing to tackle: I'm anxiously waiting for some supplier samples so I get back to experimenting in the kitchen. Until then, a bit more brand/web design to move forward with.</p>
