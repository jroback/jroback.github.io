<p>
The world of flour has gotten a lot more complicated. Not unlike how milk alternatives have flooded the grocery store, we are now presented with a huge variety of baking flours. Beside the all-purpose and whole-wheat are some less familiar grains—spelt, kamut, rice—pseudograins—quinoa, amaranth—as well as a variety of alternative sources such as besan (chickpea), almond, coconut, and chestnut flours. All have their advantages, both for usage and nutrition, but there are some needs that haven't been fully covered.</p>

<p> 
We recently had an idea for what we assumed would be our second product to market: a vegetable-based flour that is paleo friendly as well as gluten-free and low in fat. Something that could be added into "the mix" to provide balance when cooking and baking with calorically dense nut flours. Something that could both lighten the end product, as well as add positive flavor, texture, and nutrition.</p> 
<p>
After some research and experimentation we landed in the squash family. Considering it's a family whose already given us such American favorites such as zucchini bread and pumpkin pie, it's really not that foreign. The specific variety we landed on and were able to source is made-up of 100% U.S.A. butternut squash and is produced (dried) in its raw state—not roasted first like with peasemeal or besan— which allows it to maintain maximum nutritional content at a lower water activity level than traditional flours.</p>

<p>
We still have some experimenting to do in the kitchen, but if things pan out, the size of the investment and the speed to market we anticipate, make this product quite a bit more attractive than our cauliflower rice. We could potentially R+D, MVP + Test, and ultimately get this product on the market, faster. If we could pull it off, launching this product first would actually make a ton of strategic sense for our operations, but even more so for our brand. This product gives us a way to specifically reach the hardcore paleo and grain-free market. It's our chance to develop advocates before we broaden out with more convienient products. A surprise to us, but a perk to staying small and flexible. Look out for some more posts and recipes on this from our kitchen!</p>
