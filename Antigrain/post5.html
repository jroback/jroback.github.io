We've received a few samples from a few suppliers lately, and we finally made a decision for the type of drying method we are going with for our cauliflower rice: Freeze dried. While it is certainly the most expensive on the dried vegetable spectrum, freeze-drying is the only method that gives us the quality we are looking for in terms of nutritional integrity, provenance, flavor and color, while still holding up to the full gamut of cooking methods.</p>

<p>This weekend, we spent some time in the kitchen to put those cooking methods to the test. This post is our attempt to document and formalize how we've been testing the samples we've received. We tested 5 batches, using two cooking methods; pan fry, and stovetop boil; using various ratios of water and oil, and varied both the cook time and the standing time. The photo at the top of the page shows the end result from each batch (sorry the photo didn't turn out so well) and our method and notes for each batch are listed below (Left to Right in the photo).</p>

<ol class="order-test-list">
	<li value=1 class="post-list-title">Fry Pan: 1/2 cup of rice to 50 mL of boiling water with 1/4 tsp of olive oil.</li>

						<dd class="post-list-directions">Tasted good but a bit too much water and a bit oily. Revisions made in batch #3.</dd>
		</dl>

<li value=2 class="post-list-title">Stovetop Pot: 1/2 cup of rice to 37 mL of boiling water.</li>

			<dt class="post-list-heading">Directions:</dt>
				<dd class="post-list-directions">Bring water to a boil in a small pot.</dd>

<li class="post-list-title">Fry Pan: 1/2 cup of rice to 25 mL of boiling water with 1/4 tsp of olive oil.</li>
	<li>

			<dt class="post-list-heading">Directions:</dt>
				<dd class="post-list-directions">Flash-boil water in a shallow frying pan.</dd>
				<dd class="post-list-directions">Add 1/2 cup of rice and stir in until the pan is almost dry (about 30s).</dd>

					<dt class="post-list-heading">Taste Notes:</dt>
						<dd class="post-list-directions">I overcooked it a bit but the rice was nice and al dente with a nice bit of browning from the oil. Definitely the right amount of water for this cooking method.</dd>

	<li class="post-list-title">Stovetop Pot: 1/2 cup of rice to 45 mL of boiling water and 1/4 tsp of olive oil.</li>
	<li>
		<dl>
			<dt class="post-list-heading">Directions:</dt>
				<dd class="post-list-directions">Bring water and oil to a boil in a small pot.</dd>

					<dt class="post-list-heading">Taste Notes:</dt>
						<dd class="post-list-directions">Came out very well. Good amount of moisture and nice al dente texture for the cooked rice. I think letting the pot stand helped some of the moisture return to the rice without making it mushy. Adding salt (or the like) while cooking might be another solve for this.</dd>
		</dl>
	</li>


<li class="post-list-title">Stovetop Pot: 1/2 cup of rice to 45 mL of chicken broth and 1/4 tsp of olive oil.</li>
	<li>
		<dl>
			<dt class="post-list-heading">Directions:</dt>
				<dd class="post-list-directions">Bring broth to a boil in a small pot.</dd>
				<dd class="post-list-directions">Add the 1/2 cup of rice and stir in until the pan is 90% dry.</dd>
				<dd class="post-list-directions">Cover the pot with a lid and remove from heat. Let stand (covered) for 2 min before serving.</dd>
					<dt class="post-list-heading">Taste Notes:</dt>
						<dd class="post-list-directions">Another good batch. The flavor of the stock was very prevalent in the rice. This is something we will continue to experiment with in future tests.</dd>
		</dl>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="closing-p">We still have a lot left to test and play with, but so far, number 4/5 seems like the right ratio. The character of the vegetable, at this ratio, maintains the right amount of starchiness to stand-in for rice in a burrito or casserole or the like. Next up to test will be using a similar amount of Almond milk and some sauces to steam the rice and see how that holds up. Hopefully, it will resemble steamed rice and will give fuller flavor to the rice and balance out the starchiness. Also adding a few extra calories to the rice would be a good thing when we are looking at recipes like chicken and rice and other creamier dishes.</p>
