<p>
It's funny: There are days when I'll spend 10-12 hours at work, leave exhausted, and still feel like I didn't get very much done.</p>

<p> 
I've been super run down at work lately, logging a lot of time across a few different projects, and of course a lot of the time is spent in meetings, reviewing work and planning future work. It's been a while since I've had a true, heads-down work day.</p> 
<p>
Today I had on of those days, as I began prepping for the MVP run of our Cauliflower rice:</p>

<p>
Over the course of about 7 hours today, I was able to: register the name of the business with the state; create our purchase order template; fill our ingredient purchase order with our primary supplier; fill our stock packaging purchase order; filled an order for the remaining equipment we will need for the MVP run; and located and called 3 potential co-packers seeking price-quotes for the next round. The only thing I didn't get to were the labelsâ€”those still have to be created, but before that, a few more decisions need to be made.</p>

<p>
All that on top of getting to the gym and finishing two loads of laundry [and this blog post!]. It's been a while since I've crossed that many things off the list in a day. I'm feeling productive, and am getting excited for the MVP run.</p>

<p>
This run will represent the culmination of the R+D Phase, and will determine whether or not we continue forward with this product.The goal of this round is to create as close to the real product as possible, without going broke. Real enough to collect valuable feedback, pressure test the concept, and arrive at solid pricing estimate; but not so real that we are creating cylinders for packaging or going into a custom granulation with our supplier.</p>

<p>
The goal was to make it through the R+D and MVP phases in under 2 months for under $2,000. This gives us proof of concept and 200 units, or 200 packages of our conceptual product that we can use to test, give away, and collect feedback from our prospective customers. After today, It looks like we will make it on budget. I'm excited to see what we will learn and even more excited to see what we will be able to improve. The only thing I'm not excited about is hand grinding the 200 units myself.</p>
