There are lots of ways to cook chicken: boiled, broiled, grilled, and of course, fried. With fried chicken being such a crave-worthy food, I was compelled to see how some of our Anti-Grain flours would hold up as part of a fried chicken dredge. Inspired by this recipe for <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.everydaymaven.com/2013/paleo-oven-fried-chicken/">“fried” chicken</a> on EverydayMaven, I took to the kitchen with some of our butternut squash flour.</p> 

<p>
The EverydayMaven dredge called for a mix of almond flour and almond meal after the egg wash. My hypothesis was that the butternut squash flour might brown to fast if applied after the egg wash (since it has a higher sugar content than regular flour and was going to be in the oven for over an hour) so I opted to try a two stage dredge: one with only squash flour and half of the spices, before the egg wash; one without the squash flour, using only almond flour and spices, after the egg wash.</p>

<p>
In the spirit of experimenting, I wanted to know what would happen if the squash flour were applied to the “after” dredge as well. With the last piece of chicken I used the same “before” dredge, placed the chicken in the egg wash, then mixed the remaining “before" dredge with the remaining “after" dredge and dipped the chicken in that before placing it on the cooking rack.</p>


<h6>Results:</h6>

<p>
The chicken turned out really well! The squash flour definitely helped to keep the chicken moist by absorbing more of the juices, oil and spices than almond flour could on its own. The flavor complemented the almond flour nicely, and we were left with a “fried” chicken dinner that felt light and satisfying. The biggest surprise was that the best piece turned out to be the one with the squash flour at both stages of the dredge (circled with the number 2 above). It browned the chicken the perfect amount and held its form the best of all. Too bad there was only one piece. I updated the recipe based on this and posted it <a class="inline-link" href="fried-chicken.html">here.</a> Keep it in mind the next time you get a hankering for some fried chicken!</p>
